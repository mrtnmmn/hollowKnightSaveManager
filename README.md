# hollowKnightSaveManager
This is the first version of the Hollow Knight Save Manager, ill try to update it and create a fresher looking app rather than this 2010 style app
## How to download
Click the green "code" button and download the app, then run the .jar file to open the app
## How to use it 
The app will create a settings file, so i recommend placing it in a new dierectory
### How to set the saves directory
Go to your Hollow Knight save directory (is usually something like this *C:\Users\user\AppData\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight*), copy the rute and paste it into the box "Select a directory", then hit save.
I recommend relaunching the app after saving, it works fine but the names from the list does not copy into the box when an item list get selected.
### How to create a save file 
Select a user from the list, each user represents a profile from the game. Then hit the save buttond.
### Loading a save 
Select a file from the list, select the user where you want to copy it and hit the load save button.
### How to delete a save
Select a file from the list, then hit the delete button.
### How to change a save name 
Select a file from the list, change the name in the box and hit *change save name*
# Thanks for downloading
